Our environment is Adobe PhoneGap. Adobe PhoneGap provides a way for users to create mobile applications using technologies such as HTML, CSS, and Javascript. Applications created with PhoneGap can be distributed to various vendor app stores (ex: Apple App Store) and installed on a end-user's device like any other native application. Each vendor provides a different toolchain, and each PhoneGap release is compatible with a specific set of tools. PhoneGap Build is a cloud service for compiling PhoneGap applications.
